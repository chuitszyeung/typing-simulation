# Typing Simulation
A program that simulates human-typing, with average printing speeds, occasional mistakes &amp; backspaces.

## Testing the program
Download one of the three text files and the CPP source code. Put the text file in the same directory as the source code, then type in the name of the text file (with extension) on line 17 of the source code, like the example below:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wlhcode/typing-simulation/master/example.PNG)

Compile the code with a C++ compiler which supports C++11 or higher. Observe the simultation.

## Creating a text file
Simply create a text file, but only with the use of the 255 ASCII characters. Type the file name on line 17 and recompile the code.
